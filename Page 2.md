# **Italicized and Bold Text** 
## Italicized Text 
* To make a word or sentence in italics, only add 1 asterisk before and after the text you would like to italicize. Just like making text bold, make sure there is no space between the asterisk and the first letter and last letter of the subject. For example: *Hello!*
* You can also replace the asterisk with 1 underscore and have the same outcome. 

## Bold Text
* To make a word or sentence bold, add 2 asterisks before and after what you would like to bold. Also, make sure there is not a space between the asterisk and the first letter and last letter of the subject. For example: **Hello!**
* You can also replace the asterisks with 2 underscores and have the same outcome. 
***
# **How To Insert Links** 
* Name the hyperlink by using []. For example: [Link to Google!] 
* After completing the hyperlink, insert the URL immediately after, using parenthesis (). For example (https://www.google.com)
* The completed function should look like this: [Link to Google!](https://www.google.com) 
***
# **How to Create Various Sizes of Headers**
* ## This is what an H2 tag looks like! 
* To create different sized tags, you must use the # character.
* The number of #'s determines the size of header. For example: #### would be an H4 tag.
***
# How To Strikethrough 
* The strikethrough uses two tildes before and after each word or sentence you would like to strike through. (Do not add a space before and after whatever it is that you may strikethrough.) 
* Two tildes will look like this ~~ . 
* To see the function in action, lets look at an example. ~~This is an example.~~
